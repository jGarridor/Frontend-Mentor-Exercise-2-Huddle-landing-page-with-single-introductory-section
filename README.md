## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Fontawesome


### What I learned

In this oportunity my person use the flexbox to place the elements. I considered a better alternative than grid. Among the most important things I learned through the development of this project, there are:

- It can use "Background-img" and "background-size" to alocate an image as background without the use of "img" tag. Hence you have a better control and organization of the display of the picture of interest through CSS than HTML, after all, such image only works for decoration purposes. It can be used "background-repeat: no-repeat" to avoid an imge to repeat itself to cover all the document; when it is wished to cover a portion of the latter.

- Though It will be a challenge to enclose the fontawesome icons, it resulted to be quite easy to implement.

### Continued development

It feels that the page is not responsive enough and that my person abused of the media query. Is there a better alternative than use Media Query? 

I approached the project like building a house, but with divs as blocks, and then, once I liked how the elements were located, proceed to replace them with the corresponding objects. I found this approach too inconvinient, It is better to make the HTML document estructure and then, do the decoration with CSS.

For me the most important part, at the time to make a website/webpage, it is to place the elements and how they will behave whe the screen size change. What it is your approach or what is important when you do a webpage/website?
